# 685 project - Evaluate Generative Models for MedMNIST
 
## Meeting memo
**1st meeting (11.3):**

0. Created a shared GitHub repo

1. Selected three datasets:  
	PneumoniaMNIST 	(5k+, G)  
	OrganAMNIST 	(50k+, G)  
	BloodMNIST		(10k+, C)

2. Planned a timeline for the project:  
	11.17 GAN,  
	11.24 Resnet,  
	12.1 Run through experiments and make sure the processes are all correct; fine-tune the hyper-parameters  
	12.8 final report due

**2nd meeting (11.22):**

1. Review all progress
